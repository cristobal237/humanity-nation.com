          <i> Despite the fact that Sir John A. Macdonald is the main responsible 
for the fundation of CANADA his mandate as CANADA prime minister is more
negative than positive. He is responsible for the residential school system 
which lead to death of soo many indegeneous people and the destruction of many lives.
 Macdonald government practised starvation towards the indegeneous people forcing them 
towards reserve.This bring about the death of so many indegeneous and caused so many
diseases such as turberculosis. Macdonald murdereous goal was to eliminate the spiritual
and cultural believe of the indegenous people he considered separate species.
All these evil things hapenned during Macdonald mandate as prime minister of CANADA.
These tarnish CANAD history.</pre></i>

      <i>  Macdonald help us realise the banality between good and evil. he makes us know about
how permeable is the line between good and evil despite the fact that he followed the noble
goal of building a great nation he realised he could not stop him self from his murdereous
racial goal towards indegeneous people. He shows us how easy the evil seduce us and lets 
us take irrational and immorale decisions. Also because of Macdonald mandate reconciliation 
with indegeneous people was difficult.</pre> </i>

          <i> For humanity to grow we must learn from the erros of the past to avoid that
such things to repeat. Macdonald can be used to as a model for his great achievemnt
and construction of a great nation but can also serve humanity by avoiding his past errors . </pre></i>
